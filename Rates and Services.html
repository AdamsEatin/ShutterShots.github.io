<h2>Mounting</h2>
<p>Alternatively to receiving your photos on a disk, at an additional cost they can be mounted on canvas or printed and framed.

<h3>Weddings</h3>
<p>For enquiries about weddings please contact me through the form found on the Contact page.
<br><br>
The wedding package typically includes a full day of shooting, before, during and after the wedding. Photos will be processed and you have a choice of
options as to how to present them, ranging from having files on a disk for your own personal use up to a photo book prepared with your favorite photos
from the day.
