<h1> Welcome! </h1>

<p> As a student I started this business in the hopes to offer people professional portraits at an 
    affordable price. The Studio is located at 10 Harcourt street, Dublin 2.
	<br>
	CD Photo rights are available. Included in the CD option you get all the photographs as well as a copyright release form so you can take and print
	the photos at any location of your choice. You can also upload them to your computer and print unlimited copies without having to
	pay for costly packages. All photos are edited without any extra charge.
</p>

<h2> At the Studio or a Location of your Choice </h2>
<p>	The basic fee includes indoor and outdoor portraits. The studio on Harcourt street is available but I am willing to travel to any destination.
	<br>
	Travel cost is charged for anything over 20 miles.
